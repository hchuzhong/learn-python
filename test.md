Some readers read the article for repeaters that day and felt that I made it too easy to get into a 211 university, as if anyone could do it.

They felt that they just couldn't do it.

It's not that they didn't understand the method I said, but that even if they understood it, they couldn't execute it.

So they wanted to ask me why they couldn't execute it?

The answer is very simple. Let me ask you, have you ever played a game?

Have you ever found that when you play a development game, the game character is very powerful under your control, and he can almost achieve things that you dare not even think about in reality, and even a character can achieve achievements in many fields.

Why?

It's very simple, you don't treat him as a human.

He is just a game character, this is just a game, he will continue to fight as long as his health bar is empty, and he will continue to fight after he wakes up after his physical strength is exhausted.

Think about why Zhou Paopi can learn to crow like a rooster in the middle of the night?

Because he asked the farmhand to work, not himself.

That's very simple, why don't you treat yourself as a farmhand?

I am playing a game now. The so-called me in this world is just a game character. The scene of this game is called Earth. The game character you choose is your own name.

Now the game starts.

Who are you? You are Zhou Paopi. You are playing a game, playing this Earthling with your name.

If you have any ideals, let him realize them for you.

If he doesn't listen to you, beat him until he listens to you.

Emperor Taizong of Tang asked Wu Meiniang how to tame a wild horse. Wu Meiniang said, first use a whip, then a dagger, and finally a hammer.

Yes, just tame it like this.

What is a horse? Just a game prop. What is this Earthling who occupies your name? Just a game character.

If a wild horse can be tamed, what about a human?

Tame this Earthling, and then do whatever you want. If you have any ideals, you can let him realize them for you, and you can control all his time.

The name of this game is life.

There is only one reason why you have so many questions. You are here to play games, but you insist on treating that game character as yourself.

What's the point of playing then?

Before you do something, you have to ask yourself 800 times, what's the point.

I'm very curious, when you play games, do you worry about that game character, what's the point?

For something that is obviously meaningless, don't we also let that game character run around and explore the map for you out of curiosity?

Don't you let your game character lie on the bed and stare blankly before you figure out what the meaning is?

Which game player will play like this?

Do you know what playing is? It's just to tormenting the other party, to tormenting the other party to realize your ideas for you, this is called playing.

When you do something on weekdays, you have to ask yourself 800 times, what is the best path, how to minimize the loss.

I wonder, do you also look ahead and behind when playing games?

Who doesn't play first and then talk about it when playing games? I can't get through while playing, I'm stuck, and I'll look for a solution.

Isn't that how it's played?

What's the biggest cost for a game player?

It's time.

Think about why Zhou Paopi wants to learn to crow like a rooster in the middle of the night?

Because the workers have been paid, if you don't let them work, you'll lose money.

It's the same with playing games. I've paid, I'm here to play, if the game character does nothing, then I'll lose money.

Isn't it the purpose of your game to let the game character achieve everything you want to achieve as much as possible?

So do you understand?

What's your real problem?

You take yourself too seriously.

The person on earth who owns your name is not a person at all, he's just a game character.

If you insist on treating him as yourself, insist on treating him as a person, and even serve him like a boss, then you deserve to be mentally exhausted every day.

Some people may be confused. Isn't this person on earth who owns my name me? Isn't it the same as my own pain if I torment him like this?

This idea is stupid.

Do you have evidence to prove that he is you? Is there?

Come on, tell me, what is you?

Human cells rotate every seven years, that is to say, after seven years, none of your cells will be the same as you were seven years ago.

Excuse me, why is he you?

Stop it, at this stage, it is impossible for you to see the real you.

You are just living in a bunch of false appearances, living like a mess.

You are either a puppet being pulled by desires, or a fool who mistakenly thinks that he will not be pulled by strings if he lies down.

So I asked you not to talk about those useless things, play the game first, and play this earthling who occupies your name as a game character.

Don't care whether he is in pain or joy, it doesn't matter at all, he will turn into ashes sooner or later. Would you care whether a pile of fertilizer is in pain or joy?

This pile of future fertilizer, the current game character is the only tool you can control.

Just control him, let him realize all your ideas first, and let him do whatever you want.

Whether you want to take the entrance exam for Tsinghua University or Peking University, or want to make a lot of money, leave it all to him.

His time is your bargaining chip. If you don't use up today's quota, you can't save it for tomorrow.

Do you understand what I mean? He has 24 hours today, and he still has 24 hours tomorrow.

If you let him slack off for 12 hours today, it won't become 36 hours tomorrow.

The game character you control has 3600 seconds every hour, and it will still be 3600 seconds next hour.

If you let him be in a daze for 3000 seconds out of 3600 seconds every hour, I'm sorry, it won't become 6600 seconds next hour.

Do you understand what I mean?

You can only make full use of the resources at hand if you squeeze every hour, every second, and even every moment of his life, and make him highly focused and concentrated.

When will you find out who I am? Find the real me?

It's very simple, when the game character you control has realized many dreams.

After you possess this game character and experience all the ups and downs he has experienced, one day, maybe you will express the same feeling as Lu Zhishen:

Now I know that I am myself.

Only when that day comes will you find out who I am, and who you really are.

Who are you?

You are not a human being, and you have never been one.

You are just playing an immersive game. The person on earth that you possess can transmit all your feelings, including eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind, to you through sensors.

It makes you feel that you are one with him and this game character.

When one day you really understand the game, suddenly wake up and return to your original position, you will find that the entire universe is just a designed game, and the earth is just a chapter in the game.

And the reason why you play the whole game is just to wake up, to constantly stimulate your true self through controlling this game character and through rich experiences, to prompt yourself to wake up and return to the real world outside the universe.

Are you awake? If not, play the game well. If you play well, you don’t have to play again in the next life.

If you don’t play well, I’m sorry, you will have to reincarnate in the next life, maybe as a cow or a horse, as Aqina, or as Sethhei.

You feel sorry for the game character in this game, but no one will feel sorry for you, no one will feel sorry for the real you who will never wake up from the ups and downs of the sea of ​​suffering and eternal reincarnation.

But please pay attention to one thing. The topic we are talking about today is for yourself, not for others, especially for children.

Too many of us have double standards.

When they are at work, they pretend to obey the boss's orders, but when they return home, they expect their children to be like a computer and respond to whatever keys they press.

Is it possible? Do you think it is possible?

Yesterday, a full-level reader asked me about a decision about his child's future career.

I read the message and replied, "Discuss with your child, because this matter is for him to execute and spend his whole life."

As a result, the other person said without thinking, "No need to discuss, the child listens to him."

Then don't ask me, because I said it, but you didn't listen.

There are only two situations when the child listens to you. One is that he has no brains and is used to listening. How can a person who has no thinking ability take over as a boss?

The other is that he has ideas, but he has already rejected you deep in his heart, his heart is closed, and he won't tell you anything. How can he complete the handover?

This reader is obviously used to managing workers.

How do you manage workers? What you say, he does.

Are you managing workers now? No, your successor.

Doesn't the successor need a brain? What you say, he does? Is this the boss or the worker?

So the birth of talent is like a chicken, it pecks through the eggshell from the inside, this is called new life.

On the other hand, if you break its eggshell from the outside, it will be a pool of water.

The true self we are talking about today is such a thing. You set your own goals and control yourself. Slowly, your true self emerges.

If others decide whether you should take your left or right foot first when you get up every day, I'm sorry, your thinking ability will be stifled, and you will become a confused laborer.
